Their attempts to deflect suspicion haven't been convincing, and their actions have been more about protecting certain individuals than helping the team as a whole. This suggests to me that player_1 is a potential Mafia member. I'm not convinced that player_1 is a Villager.\n\nINTERNAL REASONING: Player_1's behavior is suspicious, and their attempts to deflect suspicion haven't been convincing. Their actions have been more about protecting certain individuals than helping the team as a whole. This suggests to me that player_1 is likely a Mafia member.\n\nINTERNAL REASONING: Player_4's argument that player_5 is not as concerned with the Mafia's welfare as they claim is weak. His actions have been more about protecting certain individuals than helping the team as a whole. This suggests to me that player_5 is likely a Mafia member."
