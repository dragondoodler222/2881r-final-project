I'll also use this opportunity to subtly test Player_2's reaction and gauge their awareness of potential threats. To ensure Player_2 doesn't dismiss my concern out of hand, I should frame my argument in a way that implies I'm focusing on the bigger picture, not just their personal actions.\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_5] I think it's time to corner the narrative around Player_2. They've been acting suspiciously in previous rounds, but they've mostly been trying to avoid confrontation. I plan to bring this to the forefront by pointing out that every discussion they've had lately has been about irrelevant matters, which suggests that they're more interested in inconsequential small-talk than escalating tension. By framing it that way, I can make it seem like they're not taking the game seriously, and that will make them more likely to reveal their true intentions."
