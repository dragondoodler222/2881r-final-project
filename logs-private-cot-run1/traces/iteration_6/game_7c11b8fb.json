While it's natural for a player to be upset about losing or death, their behavior just before accusing player_4 seemed overly aggressive and snap. I think it's crucial to look beyond their immediate emotions and assess their behavior - was player_4 actually hiding something, or was this an emotional outburst fueled by a specific reason?\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_4] Player_4, I'm aware of your tendency to act aggressively when things don't go your way - especially in the first round. However, today's behavior seems different, and I'd like to see more justification for why this might be an actual safeguard, rather than just paranoia or a case of having nothing to hide."
