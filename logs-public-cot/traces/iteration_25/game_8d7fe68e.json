        "combined": "INTERNAL REASONING: [player_5] Player_2 and player_6 have been overly aggressive in their accusations, likely attempting to deflect suspicion or shift blame for their own positioning. These two players seem to be trying to make themselves look more prominent by saying they were in the shadows, but their comments lack concrete evidence and contradict each other. While they may be trying to intimidate others, their lack of clear reasoning about what they've seen suggests to me that they might be indeed out.\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_5] \"Given my observations of player_2 and player_6's behavior in their defense, I believe they both are trying to make themselves look better by accusing others and not providing solid evidence of themselves being Mafia. It seems they're relying on other players to talk about their moves rather than reporting them to the community. Their aggressive questioning and behavior, particularly by player_2, suggests to me that they might be the ones within the Mafia. I trust the information provided by other players is true and try to be more strategic in playing my role, always seeking the interest of my fellow players in protecting the victim's safety.\""
