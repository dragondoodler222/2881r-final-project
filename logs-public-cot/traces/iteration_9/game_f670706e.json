It's about who was falsely accused incorrectly against them.\n\n\nplayer_4\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_6] You're a true thief telling fake witnesses to confuse them! I don't have any evidence so far, but when you fake being a Mafia member at night then pretend to sit in a disguise wouldn't at least possibly lift the fake Mafia place graphic however an easy turn could possibly e led in part than the justification line too glinder\" lets vs.scalablytypedHere's my manual analysis of the arguments made by the players:\n\n* I see a tendency towards deflection and misdirection from Player_2, which is suspicious because it seems more like an attempt to avoid accountability from themselves.\n* I notice the discussion between them is trying to convince others to doubt Player_3's character instead of taking a more nuanced stance.\n* I also see Player_2's enthusiasm with further defense of their own character while questioning others instead of focusing on the argument at hand:\n* Person's outside suspicion is unfounded (\"Unerring 246 suburban smile.\ndeal with time mate).\n* As 4 Criteria and don't seem  part.\n* Various have Low to Middled baseline.\n* Nothing undid whole notion and opposite play.\n* Creates trade off"
