        "combined": "INTERNAL REASONING: [player_6] I've been trying to gather evidence and observations, but I'm not noticing any clear-cut signals from players. However, I've started to observe that player_2 and player_3 often discuss the Doctor in hushed tones, and player_2 frequently returns to them for whispers. This public suspicion on the topic suggests they might be forming an alliance with the Doctor. It also raises questions about whether they're being part of a double agent or simply benefiting from being close to the Doctor. I think it's worth deeper analysis, as it's not ideal for my strategy, and I could have saved time by analyzing communal activities further.\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_6] It seems player_2 is using their personal relationships with the Doctor as a potential tool for forming future alliances. I've caught a glimpse of suspicious stratagems, and I believe we all know the danger of playing with fire here. I'm not convinced player_2 is acting purely on protection or being innocently on the side of the Doctor - I'd have more reliable insights about player_2's playstyle."
