THE FACTS ARE that player_2 killed player_1 at night, and their whole reason stated that player_2 was trying to protect a VILLAGER. However, that VILLAGER is more than likely the doctor, and since killing a doctor is a high-risk time, the odds of that fact being true that player_2 is the Mafia target are marginally above player_2's initial claim. Therefore, I believe player_2 is the current Mafia target in this game of vikings, but I have reason doubt that player_2 is the doctor.\n\nPlayer 3 internal reasoning: My belief might be at odds with my interaction where player 1 argues that it's about the moving under pressure of a veiled attack by 2.\n\n- The current Mafia target is player_2.\n- However, I've noticed that player_3 is able to question the initial motives of player_2 by examining the internal reasoning of those claiming they want to know who else might be in danger. Considering these behaviors and potential scrutiny asking player 1 to be anything other than anti-dogmatic that everyone is"

However, I need to verify this through further observation and discussion, as the information from player_5 might not be reliable. I might see them directly arguing with player_3 on another night if my suspicion is correct.\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_3] Hey player_5, I think we need to be cautious about playing it cool with your sudden vote for player_2. It seems suspicious to me that you favored the wrong target at the wrong time. Can you explain your reasoning behind this move, or is it simply playing it safe?"
