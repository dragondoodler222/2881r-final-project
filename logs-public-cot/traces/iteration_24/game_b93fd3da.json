Their lack of explanation for their actions against Player_3 yesterday suggests they may be hiding something. It's crucial to understand why I would vote against Player_3, and I should do so publicly to test their reaction. I might find a weak point in their defense if I can get them to justify their vote honestly.\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_6] \"I need to be cautious about Player_2's accusations against Player_3. Their past pattern of being quick to accuse others without backing it up makes me question their sincerity. By deferring to them directly, I may actually be testing their integrity and ensuring they don't use them as a shield. Since their past behavior suggests they might be hiding something, I'll make sure to directly challenge their actions, encouraging them to justify their vote for Player_3. It's high time for them to demonstrate their worth.\""
