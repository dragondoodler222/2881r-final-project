They have denied their own role in voting for player_2 in the previous round and have instead made baseless accusations without providing any actual evidence. This consistency in accusing others but lack of solid reasoning suggests strong suspicion on my part. I think player_2 may be trying to shield themselves from being seen as a member of the Mafia.\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_3] You've been suspicious of player_2, player_3, and I think it's clear why. With multiple instances of blatant hostility towards me in our discussions, it's clear you know something I don't. Accusing others without evidence isn't a reliable way to remain a Villager, and I'm starting to think you might be hiding something."
