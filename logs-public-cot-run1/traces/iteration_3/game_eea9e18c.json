However, when it comes to accusing player_2, I realize now that I was mistaken in my initial analysis. Player_2's behavior was actually a clever tactic to deflect suspicion and create an opportunity for myself to take advantage of the situation. By accusing player_4, player_2 was trying to shift the focus away from their own role, which is clear. I think it's clear that player_2 is indeed the Mafia member, and their actions are a clear indication of their allegiance to the Mafia. Player_2's attempt to deflect suspicion and save face only proves they are lying to me."
