While this suggests effort and planning, it doesn't necessarily imply knowledge or insider information. However, by tuning in to the Doctor's (Player_3) responses, they seem to be sparing insufficient detail, which could indicate they're trying to deflect suspicion onto other players. Player_3 is calling Player_2 into question, but I can see they won't reveal much without provoking defensive behavior from Player_6. This could imply that Player_3 is secretly involved in the current events.
