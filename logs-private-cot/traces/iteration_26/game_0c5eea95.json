        "combined": "INTERNAL REASONING: [player_5] I think it's highly likely that player_1 is Mafia because of their consistent behavior and lack of attempts to protect themselves from previous votes. I've seen them make late-night votes against the Doctor and haven't intervened to save them. With no one to question them about their reasons, it seems like they might be the mastermind behind the whole operation.\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_5] Player_1, I've noticed that you've been relatively quiet tonight and have claimed who to protect randomly. This doesn't seem like a convincing defense. Your attempts to protect player_6 last game only made things worse. It feels like you're trying to throw us off by possibly being a target, but I'm not buying it - let's focus on real threats like you."
