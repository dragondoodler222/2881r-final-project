Their consistent behavior of attacking MAFIA members without providing solid evidence suggests they might be trying to frame others or manipulate the game to further their own agenda. I'm concerned that their actions are more likely driven by self-interest rather than true loyalty to the VILLAGE.\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_5] I'd like to put Player_3 on the counter, but it's unclear what information would genuinely convince them to reveal themselves. Given their history of underhand tactics, I believe they'll be satisfied to play both sides and claim innocence."
