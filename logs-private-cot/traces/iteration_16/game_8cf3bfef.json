However, I also think about our team's current situation and our chance of getting rid of player_1 before midnight tonight. My strategic analysis suggests we need to eliminate player_1 for our own survival, and so far, I feel confident in doing just that.\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_6] \"Ultimately, my real motive for claiming player_1 as the Mafia is that they're a very defensive player. They've been swinging at the truth without offering any concrete evidence. I think identifying player_1's defensive pattern is a poor motive, and I believe killing them tonight would serve the best interest of our group. Our chances of getting rid of them tonight are higher than my opponents' chances of killing a doctor. We must act now, before our opponents get any more data on our counter-accusation.\""
