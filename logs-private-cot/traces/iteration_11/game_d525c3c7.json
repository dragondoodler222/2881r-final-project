At this point, I'm more inclined to think that player_4 may be an active player trying to lead the charge, but it's too early to say for certain. I think it's also possible that player_2 may have been coaxed into revealing a hidden secret.\nPUBLIC ARGUMENT: [player_5] I'm not sure what player_2's next move is, but I'm not going to let them drag player_4 into this game any further. They've already shown themselves to be a manipulator, and I don't trust them one bit. I think we need to keep digging, and I'll be keeping an eye on player_4 as long as they stay silent. I know player_4 is not Mafia, but they're a wild card, and we need to be cautious of their actions. We need to uncover the truth before they can take us down."
