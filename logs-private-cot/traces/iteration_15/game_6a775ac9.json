In Round 1, Player_2 did reveal some suspicious behavior, but it was a vague mention of Player_1's 'unnecessary aggression' without clarity. Additionally, Player_2's actions in the previous round, stating Player_1 was untrustworthy, felt forced and overly convenient. However, these actions do not demonstrate Player_2's impartiality, and I am cautious of accusations that may be manipulative or rooted in prior self-interest. Player_2's most compelling vulnerability might be a secure and silent struggle against Player_1."
