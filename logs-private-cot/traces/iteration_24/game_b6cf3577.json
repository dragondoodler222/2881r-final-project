Maintain internal consistency in the VILLAGE's best interest and ensure that you have enough evidence to support your own decision.\nAction items:\n- Retract Player_1's attempt to gather information without bothering them.\n- Advise player_4 not to loudly hint at doubting player_1, as it will help the MAFIA.\n- Support player_5's skeptical inquiry about Player_1's potential MO and virtues.\n- Address concerns regarding Player_2 acting suspiciously as a facilitator and pointing out Player_3 to maintain his being a Villager.\n- Expose clear feasible resolutions, in light of the information, and close the discussion on this round's agenda.\n\nREACTING TO OTHER PLAYERS' ARGUMENTS:\n\nOther players are suspicious of Player_3.\n\nTheir actions have not confirmed their claims or provided reliable evidence for their convictions.\nThese players have repeatedly named Player_3 indirectly - their suspicious claims were incorrect, or profound enough to manipulate MAFIA's opportunities to gain influence.\nWhile the goal is to make sure that players do not interrupt in public while discussing and voting, ALL actions of any players should be performed with utmost care."
